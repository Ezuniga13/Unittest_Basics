# Unit-Testing 

Good Unit Test will make sure that everything is running good and if not, the test will show what is broken.
For his repo I will be Unit Testing, starting on small scripts like Fibonacci functions to larger programs. I will write the main module on one script, then import that module to my testing script where I'll run various cases to make sure your everything is good before trying to put into production.
